Supervised_and_Unsupervised_with_R

# Problem Statement:

1.Dataset 1

perform supervised learning in R programming language on the advertising dataset to identify which individuals are most likely to click on ads.

2.Dataset 2

Perform clustering stating insights drawn from your analysis and visualizations.
Upon implementation, provide comparisons between the approaches  i.e. K-Means clustering vs Hierarchical clustering highlighting the strengths and limitations of each approach in the context of analysis.

In this project, 2 datasets are provided. It is required to:

(i)Problem Definition

(ii)Data Sourcing

(iii)Check the Data

(iv)Perform Data Cleaning

(v)Perform Exploratory Data Analysis  (Univariate, Bivariate & Multivariate)

(vi)Implement the Solution

(vii)Challenge the Solution

(viii)Follow up Questions

NB: The final deliverable will be either an markdown document,  which will comprise the above sections;

The master dataset is analyzed using R data science language in the R Notebook 

# Context

You are a Data analyst at Carrefour Kenya and are currently undertaking a project that will inform the marketing department on the most relevant marketing strategies that will result in the highest no. of sales (total price including tax). Your project has been divided into four parts where you'll explore a recent marketing dataset by performing various unsupervised learning techniques and later providing recommendations based on your insights.

Part 1: Dimensionality Reduction

This section of the project entails reducing your dataset to a low dimensional dataset using the t-SNE algorithm or PCA. You will be required to perform your analysis and provide insights gained from your analysis.

Part 2: Feature Selection

This section requires you to perform feature selection through the use of the unsupervised learning methods learned earlier this week. You will be required to perform your analysis and provide insights on the features that contribute the most information to the dataset.

Part 3: Association Rules

This section will require that you create association rules that will allow you to identify relationships between variables in the dataset. You are provided with a separate dataset that comprises groups of items that will be associated with others. Just like in the other sections, you will also be required to provide insights for your analysis.

Part 4: Anomaly Detection

You have also been requested to check whether there are any anomalies in the given sales dataset. The objective of this task being fraud detection.

Dataset
