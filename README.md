Supervised_and_Unsupervised_with_R

# Problem Statement:

1.Dataset 1

perform supervised learning in R programming language on the advertising dataset to identify which individuals are most likely to click on ads.

2.Dataset 2

Perform clustering stating insights drawn from your analysis and visualizations.
Upon implementation, provide comparisons between the approaches  i.e. K-Means clustering vs Hierarchical clustering highlighting the strengths and limitations of each approach in the context of analysis.

# Description

In this project, 2 datasets are provided. It is required to:

(i)Problem Definition

(ii)Data Sourcing

(iii)Check the Data

(iv)Perform Data Cleaning

(v)Perform Exploratory Data Analysis  (Univariate, Bivariate & Multivariate)

(vi)Implement the Solution

(vii)Challenge the Solution

(viii)Follow up Questions

NB: The final deliverable will be either an markdown document,  which will comprise the above sections;

The master dataset is analyzed using R data science language in the R Notebook 

# Context

Part 1

A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process. She would now like to employ your services as a Data Science Consultant to help her identify which individuals are most likely to click on her ads. 

Part 2

This section of the assessment covers unsupervised learning with R. 

Kira Plastinina (Links to an external site.) is a Russian brand that is sold through a defunct chain of retail stores in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, China, Philippines, and Armenia. The brand’s Sales and Marketing team would like to understand their customer’s behavior from data that they have collected over the past year. More specifically, they would like to learn the characteristics of customer groups.

Perform clustering stating insights drawn from your analysis and visualizations.
Upon implementation, provide comparisons between the approaches learned this week i.e. K-Means clustering vs Hierarchical clustering highlighting the strengths and limitations of each approach in the context of your analysis. 
The findings should help inform the team in formulating the marketing and sales strategies of the brand.
